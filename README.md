# Sheep Jump AI (Work in Progress)

![Sheep Jump AI](./images/game.png)

Sheep Jump AI is an AI that plays a game where sheepâ€”each being a neural networkâ€”jump to avoid fences and learns using the genetic algorithm. Implementation of the genetic algorithm is a work in progress right now.

Inclusion of fitness, features for more interactivity such as ability to adjust population size, and much more coming soon!

Game is inspired by Google Chrome's dinosaur game.

## How The Game Works (Work in Progress)

Currently 10 sheep, each with a neural network attach to them, will spawn and a sheep is eliminated when it hits a fence (sometimes there are sheep that are invincible to fences ðŸ‘€). If there are 0 sheep left, the game is over. When there are 2 sheep left, a new generation of 10 sheep is spawned. Refresh the website to spawn a new group of 10 sheep.

## How the Genetic Algorithm Works

Coming soon!

## Tools Used and More

- Built using p5.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Toy Neural Network Library JS, and Aseprite. 
- Sheep and fence graphics are created by me and background and ground graphics were redesigned from Flappy Bird.
